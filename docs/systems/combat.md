# Combat and action states

## Purpose
Action combat against beasts: a five-hit fist chain, a flying-sword dash with
i-frames and perfect dodges, and up to a few equipped techniques. Realm power
scales all player damage.

## Design intent
- Responsive on every device: the client predicts actions and hits; the server
  re-checks the same timelines and owns damage and cooldowns.
- Every enemy attack that hurts is telegraphed on the ground first, and dodging
  through it negates it. A **perfect dodge** (just before the hit) refunds
  technique cooldowns.
- Souls-style lock-on (PC T/middle mouse, gamepad R3, touch Lock button) and a
  touch **Auto** mode that locks, closes in and strikes by itself so mobile
  players only dash and cast.
- Getting hurt marks you in combat for a few seconds: no teleporting away, and
  it's the condition for a forced breakthrough.

## Key files
- `src/shared/ActionRules.luau`: the one action timeline (attack, cast, dodge),
  combo state, buffers and cooldowns, shared by client and server.
- `src/shared/Hitbox.luau`: the shared fist hitbox.
- `src/shared/Techniques.luau`: technique defs (line, circle, chain, zone, buff),
  levels (`MAX_LEVEL` 10, +8% damage a level, XP per cast).
- `src/shared/Knockback.luau`: how far player hits push beasts (by realm power
  ratio and beast weight) and the stagger they cause.
- `src/server/Combat.luau`: `action` (Attack remote: begin/hit/cancel/sync),
  damage validation, `damageEnemy`, `hurt` (i-frames, perfect dodge, Iron Skin,
  non-lethal), `power` (the stage's `power`), `inCombat`, technique XP.
- `src/server/Movement.luau`, `src/client/Movement.luau`: the only writers of walk
  speed, jump and facing (actions, running, herb buffs, meditation all feed it).
- `src/client/CombatController.luau`: input, prediction, buffering, animations.
- `src/client/ActionState.luau`: local predicted action state.
- `src/client/LockOn.luau`, `Sprint.luau`, `ShiftLock.luau` (Alt), `HeadLook.luau`.
- `src/client/CombatEffects.luau`, `Telegraphs.luau`: cosmetic effects and ground warnings.
- `src/client/TechniqueVFX.luau`: plays technique effect templates
  (`ReplicatedStorage.Effects.<Id>.<Id>_T<tier>`) through the vfxia Game Module
  (`ReplicatedStorage.vfx`, plugin-owned, not mapped); falls back to plain
  `ParticleEmitter:Emit` with a warning while the module is missing.

## Technique visuals
Casts are drawn on every client: the caster draws its own at release, the server
relays `Effect "cast"` with the caster's technique level to everyone else, and
`CombatEffects.cast(character, id, origin, dir, chain, level)` plays the tier
template for that level. Visuals must match the gameplay shape (line length and
width, circle radius, chain jumps, zone radius and seconds, buff seconds).

Timing follows the cast's action timeline (`ActionRules.castProfile`, built
from `Config.Combat.FIST_STEPS` for the technique's animation): a template's
`Windup` part plays from cast start to Hit (`CombatEffects.windup`, caster
only), `cast()` runs at Hit, emitters tagged `Phase = "active"` are fitted to
Hit -> Hit Stop (`TechniqueVFX.fit` against the root's `AuthoredActive`), and
untagged aftermath keeps its authored fade through recovery.

Templates (`ReplicatedStorage.Effects`, `assets/Effects.rbxm`, built from the
vfxia Asset Library):
- **Palm Strike** (`PalmStrike_T1..T4`, authored at radius 9, rescaled to
  `def.radius`): a gold ground shockwave from the caster's feet to the radius
  by Hit Stop, dust kicked out along the ground, a palm flash at hand height,
  and an impact on each enemy inside the radius as the front reaches it (star
  flash, spiky hit ring, sparks, drawn in front of the target with ZOffset).
  The impact also fires `CombatEffects.flash` (the caster's release-time flash
  for circles moved here). II adds an echo ring, centre rays and impact dust;
  III a rotating seal, ground cracks, debris and a wind swirl; IV a crater, a
  golden halo behind the caster, one point light and a second shake on the
  first impact. Windup: qi motes gather into the palm (III+ a closing seal).

## Data flow
Client presses -> `ActionRules` decides if legal -> plays locally and sends
`Attack { begin }`; hit reports follow as `Attack { hit, targets }` -> server
replays the timeline, checks timing (`MAX_LAG`, `CLOCK_SLACK`) and the slackened
hitbox, applies `damage * Combat.power(player)` and knockback, and acknowledges
via `Effect "action"`. Enemy attacks call `Combat.hurt`, which reports
`"perfect" | "dodged" | "hit"` and fires `Effect "hurt"`/`"perfect"`.

## Tuning knobs
- `Config.Combat`: `FIST_STEPS`, chain/reset timings, buffers, dodge
  (`DODGE_*`, `IFRAME_*`, `PERFECT_*`), hitbox and server slack, lock-on and
  auto ranges, `IN_COMBAT_SECONDS`.
- `Techniques.luau`: per-technique damage, cooldown, shape, cast timing.
  `VISUAL_TIERS` maps levels to the four visual tiers (I 1-3, II 4-6, III 7-9,
  IV 10); `TechniqueVFX.STEP_COUNT` is the extra particle count per level inside a tier.
- `Knockback.luau`: `REALM_EXPONENT`, `MIN_DISTANCE`, `ARMOR_BREAK`, stun, base pushes.
- Per stage (`Pacing.luau`): player `power` and `health` (curve and Adjust).

## Known gaps
- Palm Strike plays Fists.4, whose `Hit Stop` marker is at 0.45 s, but
  `Config.Combat.FIST_STEPS[4].hitStop` is 0.50: the hitbox window (and the
  effect's active phase, which follows Config) runs ~0.05 s of source time past
  the animation's marker. Effects follow Config until the two are aligned.
- Enemy hits don't knock players back or stagger them yet.
- An interrupted enemy windup's telegraph still plays out on clients.
- `Dodge` and `Cast` remotes in `assets/Remotes.rbxmx` are unused.
