# Enemies and spawning

## Purpose
Demon beasts in the wilds: the source of raw qi, Spirit Stones, spirit cores,
seeds, insight and technique manuals, and the main test of a player's realm.

## Design intent
- Readable fights: every damaging attack has a ground telegraph; bosses rotate a
  pattern and summon adds at health thresholds.
- Beasts cultivate on the same ladder as players (`realm`), and have a `weight`.
  Together they set how far player hits throw them: a Qi Condensation fist can't
  move the Elder Wolf King (QC9, weight 7); Foundation shoves it.
- Kill rewards scale with the killer's dantian, so old beasts stay worth hunting.
- Besides designated zones, players roaming open ground meet ambient packs drawn
  from the region they're in (`Regions.luau`: the Sect, Inner Wilds, Ruined
  Borderlands, Outer Wastes, each with the realm it's meant for), so deeper
  regions are deadlier. The sect has no ambient beasts, and none find a player
  within 90 of the sect gate or 75 of the Inner and Middle wilds arrays
  (`Spawns.Ambient.SAFE`; move these with the arrays).
- Bosses only come from their own zone and respawn timer, never from ambient
  packs (Spawner skips any `boss` def in a pack).
- Kill credit is earned, not tagged: a player gets the kill's rewards only after
  dealing `Pacing.Rewards.KILL_SHARE` of its max health (`BOSS_KILL_SHARE` for a
  boss). Whoever dealt the most always qualifies, so every kill pays someone.

## Server and client
The server is the only authority over a fight; clients only draw it, so every
player in a session sees the same beasts and nothing a client does can change one.

- **Server** (`EnemyService`): the AI state machine, targeting, telegraphed areas,
  every hit check both ways, health, damage, knockback and rewards. **No Humanoid
  and no body**: a live enemy is a Model holding one anchored, invisible root part
  (the template's `HumanoidRootPart`, grown to the body's bounds: the hit volume).
  `EnemyMover` walks it kinematically every `Config.Wilds.MOVE_TICK` (toward a goal
  at a speed, snapped to the ground, sliding along walls, refusing cliffs it can't
  climb, turning to face where it goes; knockback is a timed push; overlapping
  beasts drift apart) and writes its CFrame only when it moves. Idle beasts with no
  player within `Config.Wilds.WAKE_RADIUS` sleep: no thinking, no moving, nothing to
  replicate (one walking home is put there and healed first).
- **Wire**: model attributes `Health` + `MaxHealth`, `AIState` + `StateAt` (server time it began),
  `Attack` (the attack's `name`, default its `kind`), `DashFrom/DashTo/DashSpeed/DashAt`
  (a lunge or charge's line), `FadeAt` (dying or despawning); and the `Telegraph`
  remote `(shape, seconds, model, attack, startedAt)`.
- **Client**: `EnemyMotion` builds each enemy's body locally (a clone of its
  template from `ReplicatedStorage.EnemyBodies`, the server's copy of
  `ServerStorage.Enemies`, parented as the enemy's `Body`: anchored root, no
  collisions, its Humanoid inert) and draws it where the beast is on the server
  now, so it doesn't lag or jump for high-ping players: the last replicated spot
  plus its velocity over the time since and half the ping (at most 0.35 s), along
  the server's dash line during a dash, eased, snapping when far off. Locally the
  enemy's `PrimaryPart` is the body's root, so lock-on and effects aim at what you
  see. `EnemyAnimator` poses the body's joints from its drawn velocity and `AIState`,
  `EnemyBars` shows the body's `HealthBar` from the health attributes, `EnemySounds`
  plays voices, `Telegraphs` draws areas shortened by how late they arrived,
  `EnemyFX` plays per-beast cues and fades bodies.
- **Generous, but bounded.** A player's swing that misses the beast where it is
  now still lands if it was in the hitbox at the swing's time, rewound at most
  `Config.Combat.REWIND` (`EnemyHistory`); that cap is all a forged timestamp can
  buy, and only inside the attacker's own hitbox. An enemy strike spares a player
  whose own movement (server-seen velocity, capped at dodge speed) takes them out
  of the area within half their ping, at most `ESCAPE_LEAD`. Prediction is drawing
  only: no client position, timing or hit claim is trusted past these windows.

### Overhead health bars (EnemyBars)
Regular beasts carry a `HealthBar` BillboardGui (Dead Cells layout in the
game's lacquer-and-seal dress): a dark ink nameplate strip with the beast's name
and realm tag (`QC 4`), sitting on a long thin bar with a slanted right end. The
fill is blood-qi crimson, cut into ten slanted talisman slips (one per 10% of
health, the same count as the player's vitals bar; the divisions are drawn into
the rim art, so the slip size never depends on the beast's max health). A hit
drops the fill at once and a pale gold ghost (`Trail`) drains after it. The bar
shows while the beast is locked or for 8 s after it's hurt.

Its dressing says how dangerous the beast is **to you**: the gap between the
beast's realm and the local player's (`Realms.index`, in ladder stages) picks a
tier from `Pacing.Danger`, re-picked live when the player's `Realm` changes, so
a breakthrough makes the same beast look tamer.

| Tier | Gap (default) | Look |
|---|---|---|
| below | <= -2 | muted bronze frame, grey tag |
| even | -1 to +1 | jade frame, vermilion seal on the tip |
| above | +2 to +3 | gold frame, seal tip and lozenge cap, omen line |
| far | +4 to +5 | violet frame, long talisman tip, pulsing qi aura, sheen sweep, omen line |
| deadly | >= +6 | no name, realm or health: a pulsing cracked skull seal and an omen, shown whenever the beast is in range (90 studs) |

Omen lines are short xianxia warnings under the bar (under the skull for
deadly), one picked at random per beast per tier so it never flickers; the pools
live in `STYLES` in `EnemyBars.luau` (keep lines under ~24 characters). Bosses
skip all of this: their overhead bar stays off and the screen `Play.BossBar` is
unchanged. Art: `art/ui/draw_ui.py enemybar` (`EB` geometry, `EB_TIERS`
colours), ids in `art/ui/assets.json` (`enemybar_*`).

### Adding a beast's effects (EnemyFX)
Put `src/client/EnemyFX/<EnemyType>.luau` returning any of `windup`, `strike`,
`dash`, `stagger`, `death`, each `(cue) -> ()`; a cue is `{ model, root, kind,
attack, shape, seconds, at }` (shape and seconds left only on windup). Branch on
`cue.attack` for a boss's pattern. Skipped past 220 studs from the camera. Server
code never plays effects; if a cue is missing, add an attribute or a field on
the telegraph, not a server-side effect.

### Template contract
Templates in `ServerStorage.Enemies` stay ordinary rigs: an unrotated
`HumanoidRootPart` as PrimaryPart standing on Y 0 (its height is the beast's root
height), everything jointed or welded back to it, the `HealthBar` somewhere inside,
and a Humanoid if the rig wants one (R6 animations need its Animator; nothing
else reads it). The server uses only the root (its height and the model's bounds);
the rest is drawn by clients. Server code must never look for a body part or a
Humanoid on a live enemy, and client code finds the body under `Body`.

## Key files
- `src/shared/Enemies.luau`: defs (health, speeds, aggro/leash, attack and boss
  pattern, `qiDrop`, `stones`, `drops`, `bossDrops` (bosses' manual/weapon pool, see [weapons](weapons.md)), `realm`, `weight`), `QI_SCALE_EXPONENT`.
- `src/shared/Spawns.luau`: ambient encounter rules (rates, caps, safe spots).
- `src/shared/Regions.luau`: named regions (shape, intended realm, flavour line,
  ambient pack table).
- `src/server/Spawner.luau`: keeps zones (`Workspace.Wilds.Zones` parts with
  `Enemy`/`Count`/`Radius`) topped up with respawns (zones: GateWolves 2 Spirit Wolves
  by the Sect Gate array for the FirstKill beat, WolfPocket, WolfDen, BoarMeadow,
  BoarField, SerpentMarsh, SerpentFen, BossArena; positions in map.md), runs ambient encounters,
  `Spawner.pack` (drop a group) and `Spawner.boost` (world events).
- `src/server/EnemyService.luau`: runs beasts: `spawn(id, at, { home, roam, target })`,
  `despawn`, `onRemoved`, the state machine (idle, chase, windup, dash, recover,
  stagger), `strike` (telegraphed areas, also used by the tribulation), kill
  rewards and `onKill` hooks.
- Kill hooks: `Progression.onKill` (insight, manuals, boss pools), `Inventory.onKill`
  (drops), `Garden.onKill` (seeds).
- `src/server/EnemyMover.luau`: kinematic movement (goal, speed, push, turn,
  ground and walls).
- `src/server/EnemyHistory.luau`: each beast's recent positions, for swing lag
  compensation (`Combat.damageSwing`).
- `src/shared/Knockback.luau`; client `EnemyAnimator.luau` (procedural gait by
  `AIState`), `EnemyMotion.luau` (builds and draws the predicted body), `EnemyFX/` (per-beast cues,
  death fade), `EnemyBars.luau` (overhead and boss bars), `EnemySounds.luau`,
  `Telegraphs.luau`.
- Models: `ServerStorage.Enemies` (`assets/Enemies.rbxmx`).

## Data flow
Spawner decides where -> `EnemyService.spawn` clones the type's root-only stand-in,
sets its health attributes and tags it `Enemy` -> every client builds its body ->
AI ticks every `Config.Wilds.AI_TICK` and EnemyMover steps every `MOVE_TICK`
(sleeping beasts skip both), recording each position in EnemyHistory -> attacks set `Attack`/`AIState`, fire `Telegraph` to
clients and resolve via `Combat.hurt`; player hits go through `Combat.damageEnemy`
to `Combat.onEnemyDamaged`, where EnemyService takes the health and adds to the
beast's `damagers` tally (cleared when it walks home and heals) -> at 0 health each
credited player gets qi (capped by dantian),
stones, a kill count, and the `onKill` hooks run -> `onRemoved` lets Spawner refill.

## Tuning knobs
- Per beast: `Enemies.luau`. Ambient rates: `Spawns.luau`. Packs per region: `Regions.luau`.
- Overhead bar danger tiers: `Pacing.Danger` (`BELOW_AT`, `ABOVE_AT`, `FAR_AT`,
  `DEADLY_AT`, in realm stages); per-tier rim art, colours and omen pools in
  `EnemyBars.luau` `STYLES`; show time `SHOW_AFTER_HURT`, ghost drain `TRAIL`.
- Kill credit share: `Pacing.Rewards.KILL_SHARE`, `BOSS_KILL_SHARE`.
- Movement: `Config.Wilds.MOVE_TICK` (step and replication rate), `WALK_SLOPE`,
  `CLIMB`, `FALL_SPEED`, `TURN_RATE`, `CROWD`.
- Netcode: `Config.Wilds.WAKE_RADIUS` (sleep), `Config.Combat.REWIND`,
  `ESCAPE_LEAD`; client `EnemyMotion` `LEAD_MAX`, `STALE`, `FOLLOW`, `TURN`, `SNAP`,
  `DASH_SLACK`.
- Per stage (`Pacing.luau`, not wired yet): `beastHealth`, `beastDamage` (Adjust,
  by the beast's realm), `Global.BEAST_HEALTH/BEAST_DAMAGE`, the stage's `gather`
  for kill qi, and `Income.ENEMY_QI_EXPONENT` (replacing `Enemies.QI_SCALE_EXPONENT`).

## Known gaps
- The Pacing beast multipliers and `Realms.enemyQi` aren't read by
  EnemyService/Spawner yet.
- The Inner and Middle regions are now zone boxes (map.md "Wilds zones"); the Outer
  region is still a placeholder ring. The middle and outer regions reuse ring-1 beasts
  until their own exist.
- Enemy hits don't knock players back yet.
- The tiered overhead bars are untested in play: the aura pulse, sheen sweep and
  skull pulse, the restyle on breakthrough, and how the 150x62 px billboard reads
  on a phone with several beasts on screen. No shipped beast is far or deadly to a
  QC1 player yet (the Stone Boar at QC4 is the only "above"), so those tiers only
  show once higher-realm beasts or lower-realm players meet. A new beast template
  needs the same HealthBar (copy it from the Spirit Wolf in `assets/Enemies.rbxmx`).
- The Humanoid-free movement and netcode are untested in play, at any ping.
  Things to watch: beasts on steep or broken ground and stairs (EnemyMover has no
  pathfinding, like the Humanoid MoveTo before it: a wall it can't slide along
  stops it), cliffs, packs crowding, the body overshooting when a beast stops,
  and R6 rigs (no enemy uses one yet).
- Players and beasts pass through each other: the server root doesn't collide
  and the body is client-only.
- Techniques don't get lag compensation, only M1 swings; their areas lean on
  `AREA_SLACK`.
- Stagger shoves aren't predicted, only smoothed.
- `tools/vfx_session.luau` still builds preview dummies without `Health`
  attributes until it's regenerated from `build_vfx_session.py`
  (`vfx_preview.luau` already sets them).
- One ring of wilds: three beasts and one boss.
